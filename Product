She's a target for every psycho and miscreant this side of the Jersey Turnpike. Her mother's convinced she'll end up dead . . . or worse, without a man. She's Stephanie Plum, and she kicks butt for a living (well, she thinks it sounds good to put it that way. . . .). It begins as an innocent trip to the deli-mart, on a quest for nachos.

207252592<@@@> Lone wolf<@@@>randomhousepublishing.group@gmail.com<@@@>A life hanging in the balance a family torn apart. The #1 internationally bestselling author Jodi Picoult tells an unforgettable story about family, love, and letting go. A life hanging in the balance . . . a family torn apart. The #1 internationally bestselling author Jodi Picoult tells an unforgettable story about family secrets, love, and letting go. In the wild, when a wolf knows its time is over, when it knows it is of no more use to its pack, it may sometimes choose to slip away. Dying apart from its family, it stays proud and true to its nature. Humans aren t so lucky. Luke Warren has spent his life researching wolves. He has written about them, studied their habits intensively, and even lived with them for extended periods of time. In many ways, Luke understands wolf dynamics better than those of his own family. His wife, Georgie, has left him, finally giving up on their lonely marriage. His son, Edward, twenty-four, fled six years ago, leaving behind a shattered relationship with his father. Edward understands that some things cannot be fixed, though memories of his domineering father still inflict pain. Then comes a frantic phone call: Luke has been gravely injured in a car accident with Edward s younger sister, Cara. Suddenly everything changes: Edward must return home to face the father he walked out on at age eighteen. He and Cara have to decide their father s fate together. Though there s no easy answer, questions abound: What secrets have Edward and his sister kept from each other? What hidden motives inform their need to let their father die . . . or to try to keep him alive? What would Luke himself want? How can any family member make such a decision in the face of guilt, pain, or both? And most importantly, to what extent have they all forgotten what a wolf never forgets: that each member of a pack needs the others, and that sometimes survival means sacrifice? Another tour de force by Picoult, Lone Wolf brilliantly describes the nature of a family: the love, protection, and strength it can offer and the price we might have to pay for those gifts. What happens when the hope that should sustain a family is the very thing tearing it apart?"<@@@>380.0<@@@>360.0<@@@>20.0<@@@>340.0<@@@>159508127<@@@>deepak18@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>432<@@@> Jodi Picoult<@@@>9781439102749<@@@>2019 03 15 21:49:06 IST Mon

We beat ourselves up over our failures and, in the process, pull away from God because we subconsciously believe He tallies our defects and hangs His head in disappointment. In this newly repackaged edition now with full appendix, and the author s own epilogue, "The Scandal of Grace: "Fifteen""Years Later, Brennan Manning reminds us that nothing could be further from the truth. The Father beckons us to Himself with a furious love that burns brightly and constantly. Only when we truly embrace God s grace can we bask in the joy of a gospel that enfolds the most needy of His flock the ragamuffins. Are you bedraggled, beat-up, burnt-out? Most of us believe in God s grace in theory. But somehow we can t seem to apply it in our daily lives. We continue to see Him as a small-minded bookkeeper, tallying our failures and successes on a score sheet. Yet God gives us His grace, willingly, no matter what we ve done. We come to Him as ragamuffins dirty, bedraggled, and beat-up. And when we sit at His feet, He smiles upon us, the chosen objects of His furious love. Brennan Manning s now-classic meditation on grace and what it takes to access it simple honesty has changed thousands of lives. Now with a Ragamuffin s thirty-day spiritual journey guide, it will change yours, too. Includes a 19-Day Spiritual Journey Guide Brennan Manning does a masterful job of blowing the dust off of shop-worn theology and allowing God s grace to do what only God s grace can do amaze. "-Max Lucado, Bestselling author of The Gift for All People " I found deep comfort in realizing that Jesus loves even me, a ragamuffin, just as I am. "-Michael Card, Musician, recording artist, and author of A Violent Grace " This is a zestful and accurate portrayal that tells us unmistakably that the gospel is good, dazzlingly good. "-Eugene Peterson, Author of The Message "Story Behind the Book The world assigns value to people using measurable standards. Someone is a successful student if she receives As. Someone is a strong athlete if he runs five miles a day. The Lord, however, knows nothing of standards. "The Ragamuffin Gospel" was inspired by Brennan Manning after he discovered firsthand what it means to live by grace instead of performance. His words bring new life and sweet refreshment to Christians who are tired of never measuring up."<@@@>190.0<@@@>170.0<@@@>20.0<@@@>160.0<@@@>330493897<@@@>deepak18@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>355<@@@>Brennan Manning<@@@>9781590525029<@@@>2019 03 15 23:11:42 IST Mon

368231222<@@@>Emotional Intelligence : Why It Can Matter More Than IQ<@@@>picador123@gmail.com<@@@>Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence , we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our "two minds"--the rational and the emotional--and how they together shape our destiny. Through vivid examples, Goleman delineates the five crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships, work, and even our physical well-being. What emerges is an entirely new way to talk about being smart. The best news is that "emotional literacy" is not fixed early in life. Every parent, every teacher, every business leader, and everyone interested in a more civil society, has a stake in this compelling vision of human possibility.<@@@>290.0<@@@>270.0<@@@>20.0<@@@>250.0<@@@>64953679<@@@>deepak18@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>462<@@@> Daniel Goleman<@@@>9780553383713<@@@>2019 03 15 23:04:50 IST Mon

Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander�s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion�and in essence makes us human�shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander�s eyes popped open. He had come back. Alexander�s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself. Alexander�s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition. This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of faith will be able to ignore it.

It is an ancient story, one that originally emerged from and still deeply disturbs the mind's unconscious. In the first book of the series, Anne Rice (author of Beauty's Kingdom), writing as A.N.

536783822<@@@>Nickel and Dimed<@@@>picador123@gmail.com<@@@>Our sharpest and most original social critic goes "undercover" as an unskilled worker to reveal the dark side of American prosperity. Millions of Americans work full time, year round, for poverty-level wages. In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a job -- any job -- can be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly "unskilled," that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort. She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you int to live indoors. Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival.

Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago. Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final "class": lessons in how to live. Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world<@@@>350.0<@@@>320.0<@@@>30.0<@@@>310.0<@@@>247231362<@@@>deepak18@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>514<@@@>Mitch Albom<@@@>9780767905923<@@@>2019 03 15 22:19:14 IST Mon

This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man. Night offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.<@@@>220.0<@@@>200.0<@@@>20.0<@@@>180.0<@@@>263654123<@@@>deepak18@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>312<@@@> Elie Wiesel<@@@>9780374500016<@@@>2019 03 15 22:30:17 IST Mon

At first he resists the LAPD shrink, but finally recognizes that something is troubling him and has for a long time. In 1961, when Harry was twelve, his mother, a prostitute, was brutally murdered, and no one has ever been accused of the crime.

I. Packer's classic has been an important tool to help Christians around the world discover the wonder, the glory and the joy of knowing God. In 2006, Christianity Today voted this title one of the top 50 books that have shaped evangelicals. This edition is updated with Americanized language and spelling and a new preface by the author.Stemming from Packer's profound theological knowledge, Knowing God brings together two important facets of the Christian faith-- knowing about God and also knowing God through the context of a close relationship with the person of Jesus Christ. Written in an engaging and practical tone, this thought-provoking work seeks to transform and enrich the Christian understanding of God. Explaining both who God is and how we can relate to him, Packer divides his book into three sections: The first directs our attention to how and why we know God, the second to the attributes of God and the third to the benefits enjoyed by a those who know him intimately. This guide leads readers into a greater understanding of God while providing advice to gaining a closer relationship with him as a result.<@@@>210.0<@@@>190.0<@@@>20.0<@@@>170.0<@@@>487614737<@@@>deepak18@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>345<@@@>J.I.

703500103<@@@>Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey<@@@>intervarsity.press@gmail.com<@@@>The #1 New York Times bestselling account of a neurosurgeon's own near-death experience�for readers of 7 Lessons from Heaven. Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander�s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion�and in essence makes us human�shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander�s eyes popped open. He had come back. Alexander�s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself. Alexander�s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition. This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of faith will be able to ignore it.

800463235<@@@>Redeeming Love<@@@>mcElderry.books@gmail.com<@@@>A Story of Love That Won't Let Go - No Matter What California s gold country, 1850. A time when men sold their souls for a bag of gold and women sold their bodies for a place to sleep. Angel expects nothing from men but betrayal. Sold into prostitution as a child, she survives by keeping her hatred alive. And what she hates most are the men who use her, leaving her empty and dead inside. Then she meets Michael Hosea, a man who seeks his Father s heart in everything. Michael obeys God s call to marry Angel and to love her unconditionally. Slowly, day by day, he defies Angel s every bitter expectation, until despite her resistance, her frozen heart begins to thaw. But with her unexpected softening comes overwhelming feelings of unworthiness and fear. And so Angel runs. Back to the darkness, away from her husband s pursuing love, terrified of the truth she no longer can deny: Her final healing must come from the One who loves her even more than Michael does the One who will never let her go. A powerful retelling of the story of Gomer and Hosea, Redeeming Love is a life-changing story of God s unconditional, redemptive, all-consuming love. Includes a six-part reading group guide<@@@>200.0<@@@>180.0<@@@>20.0<@@@>150.0<@@@>686531930<@@@>amritprasad@gmail.com<@@@>yes<@@@>200<@@@> Francine Rivers<@@@>9781590525135<@@@>2019 03 15 21:11:31 IST Mon

It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself. The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one. In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth.
